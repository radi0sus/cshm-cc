# cshm-cc

A Python 3 script that calculates CShM (Continuous Shape Measures) values for various shapes, geometry indices, including τ4, τ5, *O* (octahedricity) of selected atoms from a crystallographic information file (CIF). The CIF may contain one or more entries. It can easily calculate these values from COD (Crystallography Open Database) entries by simply entering the COD number. It also saves the XYZ coordinates of the central atom and its neighboring atoms, including those from CIFs with multiple entries or COD entries and calculates the polyhedral volume. Optionally, tables in Markdown format containing bond lengths and angles can be generated.
